This project is a simple blogging web application that may support a users ability to login, create a post, delete a post, and edit a post. For Now this will be a simple one page web application that offers functionality through the tab bar at the top of the application. The posts will be shown in the order they are posted and saved into a database. This database will help us store the post and user data so they can access and edit in the future. A rough outline of my original design can be found in the my-design.pdf file inside of this directory.
